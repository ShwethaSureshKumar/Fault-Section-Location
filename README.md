# Fault-Section-Location
The paper, entitled "A Fault Section Location Method for Distribution Networks Based on Divide-and-Conquer" by Qiao Zhao , Zengping Wang , Guomin Li , Xuanjun Liu and Yuxuan Wang published on 12 May 2023 introduces a fault location approach based on the divide-and-conquer (DAC) methodology, addressing limitations in traditional fault section location methods concerning speed and accuracy as distribution network scales grow. 
- By leveraging road vectors to depict fault-device causal connections and transforming logical operations into a numerical computational model, a fault location model is established.
- This model aligns with the recursive structure of DAC, incorporating an optimization-seeking variable termed "approximation gain" where each recursion level involves linear-time approximation gain operations and constant-time decomposition and combination operations.
- The above provided code serves as a practical demonstration aligning with the principles outlined in the fault location approach presented in this paper, showcasing how the DAC methodology can be realized to address the complexities of fault localization in large-scale distribution networks.
